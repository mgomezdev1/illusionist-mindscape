Hey!

To change the colors of your weapons go to BLINK>Material Tiling Offset

1. Drag and drop the weapon(s) from the hierarchy to the Weapon Game Objects list
2. Click Initialize
3. Play with the slider

Different options to save the color:

1. Save the material by clicking "CREATE MATERIAL"
2. Add the Material Tiling Offset script on the weapon, select it and click "SAVE SELECTION" from the editor tool window. This will initialize the weapon, once in game, with the desired color while keeping 1 material only for all weapons!

Let me know if you have questions!
